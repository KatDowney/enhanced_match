**Market Extension Sales Analysis**

Answering questions:

1. How many sales did Auto Trader influence (split by the usual VRM, Site, Group level)?

2. How many sales were through the Market Extension product?

3. What is the total value/profit of cars sold through Market Extension vs. Traditional

4. How far away are they from the advertiser vs. Traditional sites?

5. How does conversion to sale differ broken down by distance the consumer is from the advertiser?

6. When the consumer buys through market extension, was the closest ME site available to them?

7. How do this vary by consumer demographic? (e.g. rural vs. urban)

8. How do this vary by sold vehicle type? (e.g. standard vs. premium)

9. How many cars are transported to achieve the Market Extension sale?

10. What is the distribution of distance travelled & when is it longer/shorter? (e.g. certain geographical hotspots      are resulting in higher proportion of transportation)

11. How many transportations result in no sale & are there any common themes for when this happens 

12. What volume of consumer's that buy through Market Extension, would ME custmer have been in their consideration       set without the product?

13 How does Market Extension change the consumer's buying journey (volume of adviews/interactions that are ME            customer, when in the journey, etc.)

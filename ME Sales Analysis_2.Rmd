**Purpose of analysis**
Enhanced match data to investigate changes determined by switching from Centrally Held Market Extension product to the Location Plus product.
------------------------
**ME Locations**
------------------------
[ME Locations] (https://autotrader.eu.looker.com/explore/customer_performance/retailer_performance?qid=UOGyp76yoNhXo6N30w1V43&toggle=dat,fil,vis,vse)
![ME Locations](./pictures/location_of_sites.png)
Currently locations are closely grouped together in the South East region of the UK.
------------------------
**Me Product Timeline**

![ME Product Timeline](./pictures/change_to_location_plus.png)
Above is a timeline of stock on the Market Extension, centrally held stock on 'DCC Online' until June 2021 then moving onto the Location Plus product, where stock increased and moved to each DCC Dids.

Group matches for May and June 2021 are currently not correct, work is going on to fix this and we expect group matches to be higher. July 2021 sold vehicles is much higher due to increased stock in that particular month.

**What is the total value/profit of cars sold through Market Extension**
With only enriched data for July 2021 we can only see the average profit is a round the £1000 - £2000 mark. We can also see that average profit has not changed the further from  the did location  the sale is.
-------------------------------------

-------------------------------------
**What is the total value/profit of cars sold through Market Extension - product add ons**
Looking at the enriched profit data for July the cars sold with 'add ons' (finance etc) those without add ons appears to have a higher average profit

**How does distance between buyer & seller vary by sold vehicle type (e.g. standard vs. premium)?**
Premium vehicle sales are likely to come from 21-50 miles, whereas standard vehicles are being purchased from further.

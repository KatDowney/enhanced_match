-------------------------------------
**What is the total value/profit of cars sold through Market Extension**
Enriched Profit was only available for July 2021 but from this data we see tha the average profit per car was around the £1000 - £2000 mark.
-------------------------------------
```{r profit, echo = TRUE}

vrm_agg <- vrm_agg %>%
        mutate(viewed_distance_banding = ifelse(matched_viewed_distance_between <10, "less than 10 miles",
                                         ifelse(matched_viewed_distance_between <20, "less than 20 miles",
                                         ifelse(matched_viewed_distance_between <50, "less than 50 miles",
                                        ifelse(matched_viewed_distance_between <100, "less than 100 miles",
                                        ifelse(matched_viewed_distance_between >=100, "100 or more miles", NA))))))


vrm_agg$viewed_distance_banding <- factor(vrm_agg$viewed_distance_banding, levels = c("less than 10 miles", "less than 20 miles", "less than 50 miles", "less than 100 miles", "100 or more miles", NA), ordered = TRUE)


profit_agg <- vrm_agg %>%
            filter(no_match_flag == 0) %>%
            group_by(viewed_distance_banding) %>%
            summarise(row_count = n(),
                      distinct_sales = n_distinct(sold_vrm),
                      avg_profit = mean(profit_margin, na.rm = TRUE))

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(vrm_agg$profit_margin, col = 'skyblue3', breaks = 20, xlab = 'profit margin', main = "Avg profit distribution")

barplot(profit_agg$avg_profit, names.arg = profit_agg$viewed_distance_banding, col = 'steelblue', main = "Avg profit by distance", xlab = "Distance Banding", ylab = 'Mean Profit' )

```


-------------------------------------
**What is the total value/profit of cars sold through Market Extension - product add ons**
Looking at the enriched profit data for July the cars sold with 'add ons' (finance etc) those without add ons appears to have a higher average profit
-------------------------------------

```{r finance, echo = TRUE}

has_finance <- vrm_agg %>%
            filter(value_added_products_flag == 1)


no_finance <- vrm_agg %>%
            filter(value_added_products_flag == 0)



par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(has_finance$profit_margin, col = 'skyblue3', breaks = 20, xlab = 'profit margin', main = "Avg profit distribution -  add ons")
hist(no_finance$profit_margin, col = 'skyblue3', breaks = 20, xlab = 'profit margin', main = "Avg profit distribution - no add ons")


par(mfrow=c(1,1))

```

------------------------------------------
**Distance and profit add ons**
Spliting the profit add on data by distance bandings we can see that average profit is slightly higher further away for sales without add ons. More data is needed from consecutive months to understand this trend.
------------------------------------------
```{r finance add ons, echo = TRUE}

has_finance_profit <- vrm_agg %>%
            filter(value_added_products_flag == 1) %>%
            filter(no_match_flag == 0) %>%
            group_by(viewed_distance_banding) %>%
            summarise(row_count = n(),
                      distinct_sales = n_distinct(sold_vrm),
                      avg_profit = mean(profit_margin, na.rm = TRUE))

no_finance_profit <- vrm_agg %>%
            filter(value_added_products_flag == 0) %>%
            filter(no_match_flag == 0) %>%
            group_by(viewed_distance_banding) %>%
            summarise(row_count = n(),
                      distinct_sales = n_distinct(sold_vrm),
                      avg_profit = mean(profit_margin, na.rm = TRUE))

```

------------------------------------------
**How far away is the buyer to the seller?**
With the move to location + we've seen less sales from the 100 + miles away from the sites
------------------------------------------

```{r distance, echo= TRUE}

# create distance aggregation to show how distance buyer travels changes over time
distance_matches <- vrm_agg %>%
                      filter(!is.na(viewed_distance_banding)) %>%

**How does distance between buyer & seller vary by sold vehicle type (e.g. standard vs. premium)?**
Premium vehicle sales are likely to come from 21-50 miles, whereas standard vehicles are being purchased from further.

**Purpose of analysis**
Enhanced match data to investigate changes determined by switching from Centrally Held Market Extension product to the Location Plus product.
------------------------




**ME Locations**

![ME Locations](./pictures/location_of_sites.png)

Currently locations are closely grouped together in the South East region of the UK.

Group matches for May and June 2021 are currently not correct, work is going on to fix this and we expect group matches to be higher. July 2021 sold vehicles is much higher due to increased stock in that particular month.
